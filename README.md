#Movie-Recommender

A recommendation system is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the “rating” or “preference” a user would give to an item and putting in a simple language “a recommendation system suggest anything relevant based on the used interest”.

The recommendation system is classified into two type Content-Based and Collaborative based recommendation system.

Content-based recommendation system is to recommend an item based on a comparison between the content of the items and a user profile.In simple words,I may get recommendation for a movie based on the description of other movies.

In this project i have built a end to end movie recommendation system with CI/CD pipeline implemented and deployed on Heroku

I have used a movie dataset from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata?select=tmdb_5000_movies.csv
